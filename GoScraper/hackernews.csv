"Title:Privileged Accounts, Hidden Threats: Why Privileged Access Security Must Be a Top Priority","Privileged accounts are well-known gateways for potential security threats. However, many organizations focus solely on managing privileged accessâ€”rather than securing the accounts and users entrusted with it. This emphasis is perhaps due to the persistent challenges of Privileged Access Management (PAM)  deployments. Yet, as the threat landscape evolves, so must organizational priorities. To prevent trust from becoming a liability, the next step in securing privileged access must become a critical focus.  In this blog, we explore why managing privileged access alone is insufficient and provide actionable insights to help you craft a security-first strategy for privileged access.  The Evolution of PAM  Privileged Access Management (PAM) has long been a cornerstone of securing an organization's privileged users  and critical resources. PAM's primary goal is to control, monitor, and safeguard privileged accounts, which often have elevated access to critical systems and data. These accou","Nov 19, 2024"
Title:New 'Helldown' Ransomware Variant Expands Attacks to VMware and Linux Systems,"Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on a Linux variant of a relatively new ransomware strain called Helldown, suggesting that the threat actors are broadening their attack focus.  ""Helldown deploys Windows ransomware derived from the LockBit 3.0 code,"" Sekoia said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. ""Given the recent development of ransomware targeting ESX, it appears that the group could be evolving its current operations to target virtualized infrastructures via VMware.""  Helldown was first publicly documented  by Halcyon in mid-August 2024, describing  it as an ""aggressive ransomware group"" that infiltrates  target networks by exploiting security vulnerabilities. Some of the prominent sectors targeted by the cybercrime group include IT services, telecommunications, manufacturing, and healthcare.

Title:New Stealthy BabbleLoader Malware Spotted Delivering WhiteSnake and Meduza Stealers,"Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on a new stealthy malware loader called BabbleLoader that has been observed in the wild delivering information stealer families such as WhiteSnake  and Meduza .  BabbleLoader is an ""extremely evasive loader, packed with defensive mechanisms, that is designed to bypass antivirus and sandbox environments to deliver stealers into memory,"" Intezer security researcher Ryan Robinson said  in a report published Sunday.  Evidence shows that the loader is being used in several campaigns targeting both English and Russian-speaking individuals, primarily singling out users looking for generic cracked software as well as business professionals in finance and administration by passing it off as accounting software.   Loaders have become an increasingly prevalent method to deliver malware, like stealers or ransomware, often acting as the first stage in an attack chain in a manner that sidesteps traditional antivirus defenses by incorporating a be","Nov 18, 2024"
Title:The Problem of Permissions and Non-Human Identities - Why Remediating Credentials Takes Longer Than You Think,"According to research from GitGuardian and CyberArk, 79% of IT decision-makers reported having experienced a secrets leak , up from 75% in the previous year's report. At the same time, the number of leaked credentials has never been higher, with over 12.7 million hardcoded credentials in public GitHub repositories alone . One of the more troubling aspects of this report is that over 90% of valid secrets found and reported remained valid for more than 5 days.  According to the same research, on average, it takes organizations 27 days  to remediate leaked credentials. Combine that with the fact that non-human identities outnumber human identities by at least 45:1 , and it is easy to see why many organizations are realizing stopping secrets sprawl means finding a way to deal with this machine identity crisis. Unfortunately, the research also shows that many teams are confused about who owns the security of these identities. It is a perfect storm of risk.Â   Why Does Rotation Take So L","Nov 18, 2024"
Title:5 Ways Behavioral Analytics is Revolutionizing Incident Response,"Behavioral analytics, long associated with threat detection (i.e. UEBA or UBA), is experiencing a renaissance. Once primarily used to identify suspicious activity, it's now being reimagined as a powerful post-detection technology that enhances incident response processes. By leveraging behavioral insights during alert triage and investigation, SOCs can transform their workflows to become more accurate, efficient, and impactful. Fortunately, many new cybersecurity products like AI SOC analysts are able to incorporate these techniques into their investigation capabilities, thus allowing SOCs to utilize them into their response processes. This post will provide a brief overview of behavior analytics then discuss 5 ways it's being reinvented to shake up SOC investigation and incident response work. Behavior Analysis is Back, But Why?

Title:Gmail's New Shielded Email Feature Lets Users Create Aliases for Email Privacy,"Google appears to be readying a new feature called Shielded Email that allows users to create email aliases when signing up for online services and better combat spam.  The feature was first reported  by Android Authority last week following a teardown of the latest version of Google Play Services  for Android.  The idea is to create unique, single-use email addresses that forward the messages to the associated primary account, thereby preventing the need for providing the real email address when filling out forms or registering for new services online.   The idea of email aliases for improved privacy is not new. Back in 2021, Apple introduced  a similar feature called Hide My Email that allows iCloud+ subscribers to generate  random burner email addresses. It can also be used to set up new ones in Safari, Mail, and Apple Pay wherever email addresses are required.  Other providers like Bitwarden  and DuckDuckGo  have since also released an analogous feature. It's worth noting that","Nov 18, 2024"
Title:Beyond Compliance: The Advantage of Year-Round Network Pen Testing,"IT leaders know the drillâ€”regulators and cyber insurers demand regular network penetration testing  to keep the bad guys out. But here's the thing: hackers don't wait around for compliance schedules.  Most companies approach network penetration testing on a set schedule, with the most common frequency being twice a year (29%), followed by three to four times per year (23%) and once per year (20%), according to the Kaseya Cybersecurity Survey Report 2024 . Compliance-focused testing can catch vulnerabilities that exist at the exact time of testing, but it's not enough to stay ahead of attackers in a meaningful way.  Why More Frequent Testing Makes Sense  When companies test more often, they're not just checking a box for complianceâ€”they're actually protecting their networks. The Kaseya survey also points out that the top drivers for network penetration testing are:   Cybersecurity Control and Validation (34%)  â€“ ensuring the security controls work and vulnerabilities are minimized.
